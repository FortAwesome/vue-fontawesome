## [2.0.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome/releases/tag/2.0.0)  - 2020-09-01

This release marks the official major release of the component as preparation
for supporting two different versions of Vue.

### What is the difference between 0.1.10 and 2.0.0?

There is no difference. We've jumped the version to 2.0.0 so you know which
version of vue-fontawesome you should install based on what version of Vue you
are using.

### What version should you install?

|         | Vue | vue-fontawesome |
| ------- |-----|-----------------|
| Version | 2.x | 2.x or 0.1.x    |
| Version | 3.x | 3.x             |

While you can still use 0.1 with Vue 2.x, we recommend upgrade to the 2.x
release. The 0.1 release line will not be getting any further updates.
